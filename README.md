## Question

Create a Java class named "ArrayListOperations" and implement the relevant methods
to perform the following tasks.

1. Implement a method named
"removeOddNumbers" that takes an ArrayList of integers as input. This method should
remove all the odd elements from the input integer list and print the remaining numbers

Sample Output:

Input -> 4,5,8,9,7,3
Output -> 4,8

3. Implement a method named

"doubleEvenNumbers" that takes an ArrayList of integers as input. This method should
double all the even elements from the input integer list and print only the new values.

Sample Output:

Input -> 4,5,8,9,7,3
Output -> 8,16

4. Create a Java class named "TestOperations" with the main method to accept 5
integer values and save those in an ArrayList.
Pass the user-entered values to the above two methods and display the output
separately
